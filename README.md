# Event-Driven Order Processing System (Java)


## Features
- Domain Model: `Order`, `OrderItem`, `OrderStatus`
- Events: `OrderCreatedEvent`, `PaymentReceivedEvent`, `ShippingScheduledEvent`, `OrderCancelledEvent`
- Ingestion: Read from a `.jsonl` file (one event per line)
- Processing: Maintains orders and transitions status (`PENDING` â†’ `PARTIALLY_PAID` â†’ `PAID` â†’ `SHIPPED`/`CANCELLED`)
- Observers: `LoggerObserver` and `AlertObserver`


## Build & Run
```bash
mvn -q clean package
java -cp target/classes:$(mvn -q -Dexec.executable=echo --non-recursive \
org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:3.5.0:classpath -Dexec.args='%classpath') \
org.example.ordersystem events.jsonl
```
> On Windows PowerShell, replace the classpath with `;` instead of `:` and consider running via IDE.

## Run in IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended ðŸš€)

1. Open the project in IntelliJ (**File â†’ Open** and select the project root).  
2. Wait for **Maven** to download & index dependencies.  
3. Open `src/main/java/org/example/ordersystem.java`.  
4. Right-click on the `main` method â†’ **Run 'ordersystem.main()'**.  
5. Configure program arguments:  
   - Go to **Run â†’ Edit Configurationsâ€¦**  
   - Select your run configuration (`Application`)  
   - In the **Program arguments** field, enter:  
     ```
     events.jsonl
     ```
6. Place your `events.jsonl` file in the **project root** (same folder as `pom.xml`).  
7. Run again â†’ Output will appear in **IntelliJ console**.  



## Sample Input (`events.jsonl`)
```json
